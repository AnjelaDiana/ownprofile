									<b>Abstract:</b></br>
									â€”The study of sending and receiving secret messages
is called cryptography. Generally, senders and receivers are
unaware about the process of encryption and decryption. Hence,
encryption plays an important role in data communication and
data security. The meaning of encryption is not only to keep
data confidential from unwanted access but also ensuring the
data integrity through available way. As the capacity of breaking
the security is increasing rapidly, so, the process that hides information is one of the most concerned topics. Advanced Encryption
Standard is a popular, widely used and efficient encryption
algorithm, which has been used since it was invented. This paper
focuses on the AES key generation process and Substitution
box. It modifies the conventional key generation technique and
builds the dynamic 3-Dimensional S-box of Advance Encryption
Standard. The proposed approach suggests 3-Dimensioanl Key
Generation Matrix and S-box. As per shown this novel technique
increases the amount of time it needs during encryption and
decryption. The experimental result shows that it also enhances
the strength of AES algorithm. The proposed approach illustrates
the theoretical analysis and corresponding experimented results.

									<b>Abstract:</b></br>
In today's world social networking is an important (powerful) medium of mass communication. People of almost all classes have been interacting each other and sharing their views, moments and ideas by using enormous user friendly applications in different social networking sites. It is really unbelievable to find a person who has never heard about the social networking system. The available social networking sites usually opportune their users to develop various customized applications through particular templates and embedded sources of codes. The users with average knowledge of development often encounter difficulties to reuse those resources and eventually lack guidelines and necessary API recommendations. In our work, we have proposed a framework and model to help those apps developer through a user assistance plug-in tool that is able to provide identical API usage patterns and sequences in response to a particular user query. We have titled our system as Social Networking Application Plug-in (SNAP). It searches social networking apps repository where multiple storage are bridged and apply respective mining algorithm to find the relevant sequences to fulfill the user needs. It provides similar, most relevant and functional API usage scenarios as well as gives an option to choose, reuse and modify the recommended sources. From the investigations we have ever made, the SNAP approach is capable to recommend error-free, understandable and minimal API patterns

									<b>Abstract:</b></br>
									Successfully predicting agricultural economy leads to maximum
benefit and best effort utilization for farmers. It is very important
and challenging to make correct agricultural decisions for a future
stable price and yield balance. For the failure of this prediction,
knowledge from historical data could not be used properly for managing agricultural revenue affecting factors.The objective of this research work is to develop an advance and efficient system for predicting future price and yield of agricultural crops considering inflation which is affected by climate conditions and other situational
factors. At first, the Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA)
Model was used for the work but the best estimates would always
show a sudden and steep drop in the yield for every crop and would
not show an increase until years later. Then the Weighted Linear
Regression model was used by giving more weight to recent data
which results 78.75% and 83.55% correct prediction for price and
yield respectively after comparing the actual and predicted values
over previous three years. Initially three types of rice of Bangladesh
(Aus, Aman and Boro) are analyzed and there is scope for extensive
use of this method.

									<b>Abstract:</b></br>
									Now-a-days, the release of hazardous gases is one of the major threat not only for the environment but also for climate and lives. Both global and local extensive ecological damage is responsible for this case. There are a number of sources for gas emission, like; exhaust gases from industry as well as traffic, fires flue gases, waste disposals, various incidents at the chemicals geo-dynamically active regions, Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) areas, gases over industrial sites, landfill sites, and contaminated areas. In these cases, a quickly localization of gas leaks as well as monitoring the potential areas of gas emission are necessary. In our research work, we proposed an approach to integrate various 2D multi-gas distribution mapping with various cascade-able modules placed in a bus logic design over a wired and wireless based sensor network. Though all the modules are cascade-able and placed in a line with common bus designed into the system, so it is possible to add or remove any number of modules at any time. For every single gas we predefined a particular gas intensity threshold as PPM (Parts Per Millions) into the main controller for every module. With the compare of present sensor values and the predefined values, our system can able to track the significant change over gas adsorption and also the scale level of its derogative. With the presumption of a hazardous situation over gas distribution, we also proposed an adapting process of generating alarms. These alarm generating processes works over two basis; one is live alarm that for the local area and another is distance alarm that generated in a particular connection device for the system administrator. In our work, we focus on the measurement of 2D multi-gas consent ration by using versatile gas sensors, then locate the level of gas emission with alarm generating process at the case of hazardous situations. With the overall approaches, we can say that this system can be helpful for industrial control and also for environmental monitoring and safety and security related fields.

									<b>Abstract:</b></br>
									The study of sending and receiving secret messages is called cryptography. Senders and receivers do not have any idea of processing the ciphertext and retrieving the corresponding plaintext. Hence, encryption plays an important role in data communication and data security. The meaning of encryption is not only in sense of hiding data from the hackers and unwanted users but also sending data in a complex form for data security. As the attacker's capabilities are increasing over the communication and data storage, so information security is the most concerned topic at present. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most highly secured and efficient encryption algorithms, which is used from earlier for data security. This paper is focused on the AES key generation process and Substitution box (S-box), here we represent secret key generation technique based on modified 3-dimensional extended Polybius Cube and dynamic 3-dimensional S-box rather than the ordinary one which can decrease the hardware complexity as well as faster the encryption process and can be changed dynamically and also increase the strength of AES algorithm. In our approach, with the theoretical analysis as well as experimental results we can show that our modified key generation technique and S-box can increase the strength of AES.
